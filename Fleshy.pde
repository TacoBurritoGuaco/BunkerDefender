    //Alright, to break the above math down:
    //First and foremost, we find the displacement between each vector by dividing displacementY by displacementX
    //Then, this value is turned into the angle (in radians) by tan inverse, which we then plug into sin for y (Opposite over Hypotenuse) and cos for x (Adjacent over Hypotenuse)
    //This value will then be turned into the velocity vector, and then multiplied by the enemy's speed
    //Finnally, this is then multipled by each corresponding displacement's unit vector
    //Note: The result of atan for sin is turned into an absolute value because the sin function cannot take negative values (although, cosine does not have the problem)

    return(newPos); //return this new directional vector
